# üîê Security Guide - Tweener Insights Dashboard

## Overview
This guide covers security best practices for the Tweener Insights Dashboard.

## Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Encrypted database connections** for sensitive financial data
- **Environment variable support** for secure credential storage
- **HTTPS support** for production deployments
- **Secure API key management** for external integrations

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
Store sensitive configuration in environment variables:
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname

# API Keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
GMAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

### 2. HTTPS in Production
Always use HTTPS in production environments:
- Configure SSL certificates
- Use secure headers
- Enable HTTPS redirects

### 3. Database Security
- Use strong database passwords
- Enable SSL connections
- Regular database backups
- Restrict database access

### 4. API Key Management
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use environment variables for storage
- Monitor API usage
- Set appropriate rate limits

### 5. Regular Security Updates
- Update dependencies regularly
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Keep deployment environments updated

## File Security

### Protected Files
- `.env` - Contains sensitive environment variables
- `credentials.json` - Gmail API credentials
- `token.json` - Gmail API tokens

### File Permissions
Ensure sensitive files have restricted permissions:
```bash
chmod 600 .env
chmod 600 credentials.json
chmod 600 token.json
```

## Deployment Security

### Local Development
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Don't commit credentials to version control
- Use `.env` files for local configuration

### Production Deployment
- Use environment variables for all credentials
- Enable HTTPS
- Configure proper firewall rules
- Regular security audits
- Monitor access logs

## Data Privacy

### Financial Data
- All portfolio company data is stored securely
- Database connections use encryption
- Access is controlled through deployment environment

### Email Integration
- Gmail API credentials are stored securely
- Email processing is automated and secure
- No sensitive data is logged

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database connection errors**: Check DATABASE_URL and credentials
2. **API key errors**: Verify API keys are set correctly
3. **Permission errors**: Check file permissions on sensitive files

### Security Incidents
If you suspect a security breach:
1. Immediately rotate all API keys
2. Review access logs
3. Check for unauthorized access
4. Update security configurations
5. Notify relevant stakeholders

## Compliance Notes

### Data Protection
- Financial data is stored securely
- Database connections are encrypted
- No sensitive data is logged

### Access Control
- Dashboard access is controlled through deployment environment
- API access is secured with proper authentication
- Database access is restricted
